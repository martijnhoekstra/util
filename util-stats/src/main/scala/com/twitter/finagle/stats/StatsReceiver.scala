 * Each metric created via a stats receiver has a [[Verbosity verbosity level]] attached to it.
 * Distinguishing verbosity levels for metrics is optional and is up to a concrete implementation.
 * Doing this, however, helps to separate [[Verbosity.Debug debug metrics]] (only helpful in
 * troubleshooting) from their [[Verbosity.Default operationally-required counterparts]] (provide
 * a corresponding degree of visibility into a healthy process) thus potentially reducing the
 * observability cost.
 *
 * Metrics created w/o an explicitly specified [[Verbosity]] level, will use [[Verbosity.Default]].
 * Use [[VerbosityAdjustingStatsReceiver]] to adjust this behaviour.
