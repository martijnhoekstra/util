/**
 * This test suite is intended to test capture points defined in [TwitterFuturesCapturePoints.xml].
 * The test name corresponds to the capture point being tested and is named in the format
 * [Class.method]. Because of the limitations of reflection, we only test for [Capture class
 * and method] and [Insert class and method]. This means that the [key-expression] is not
 * tested for. As such, these tests will only fail if the class name or method for which a
 * capture point depends on has either changed or doesn't exist anymore.
 *
 * In the case that the [Insert class-name] or [Capture class-name] has been changed or
 * doesn't exist, this file will fail to compile.
