/**
 * A synchronous in-memory pipe that connects [[Reader]] and [[Writer]] in the sense
 * that a reader's input is the output of a writer.
 *
 * A pipe is structured as a smash of both interfaces, a [[Reader]] and a [[Writer]] such that can
 * be passed directly to a consumer or a producer.
 *
 * {{{
 *   def consumer(r: Reader[Buf]): Future[Unit] = ???
 *   def producer(w: Writer[Buf]): Future[Unit] = ???
 *
 *   val p = new Pipe[Buf]
 *
 *   consumer(p)
 *   producer(p)
 * }}}
 *
 * Reads and writes on the pipe are matched one to one and only one outstanding `read`
 * or `write` is permitted in the current implementation (multiple pending writes or reads
 * resolve into [[IllegalStateException]] while leaving the pipe healthy). That is, the `write`
 * (its returned [[Future]]) is resolved when the `read` consumes the written data.
 *
 * Here is, for example, a very typical write-loop that writes into a pipe-backed [[Writer]]:
 *
 * {{{
 *   def writeLoop(w: Writer[Buf], data: List[Buf]): Future[Unit] = data match {
 *     case h :: t => p.write(h).before(writeLoop(w, t))
 *     case Nil => w.close()
 *   }
 * }}}
 *
 * Reading from a pipe-backed [[Reader]] is no different from working with any other reader:
 *
 *{{{
 *   def readLoop(r: Reader[Buf], process: Buf => Future[Unit]): Future[Unit] = r.read().flatMap {
 *     case Some(chunk) => process(chunk).before(readLoop(r, process))
 *     case None => Future.Done
 *   }
 * }}}
 *
 * == Thread Safety ==
 *
 * It is safe to call `read`, `write`, `fail`, `discard`, and `close` concurrently. The individual
 * calls are synchronized on the given [[Pipe]].
 *
 * == Closing or Failing Pipes ==
 *
 * Besides expecting a write or a read, a pipe can be closed or failed. A writer can do both `close`
 * and `fail` the pipe, while reader can only fail the pipe via `discard`.
 *
 * The following behavior is expected with regards to reading from or writing into a closed or a
 * failed pipe:
 *
 *  - Writing into a closed pipe yields [[IllegalStateException]]
 *  - Reading from a closed pipe yields EOF ([[Future.None]])
 *  - Reading from or writing into a failed pipe yields a failure it was failed with
 *
 * It's also worth discussing how pipes are being closed. As closure is always initiated by a
 * producer (writer), there is a machinery allowing it to be notified when said closure is observed
 * by a consumer (reader).
 *
 * The following rules should help reasoning about closure signals in pipes:
 *
 * - Closing a pipe with a pending read resolves said read into EOF and returns a [[Future.Unit]]
 * - Closing a pipe with a pending write by default fails said write with [[IllegalStateException]] and
 *   returns a future that will be satisfied when a consumer observes the closure (EOF) via read. If
 *   a timer is provided, the pipe will wait until the provided deadline for a successful read before
 *   failing the write.
 * - Closing an idle pipe returns a future that will be satisfied when a consumer observes the
 *   closure (EOF) via read when a timer is provided, otherwise the pipe will be closed immedidately.

  // Implementation Notes:
  //
  // - The the only mutable state of this pipe is `state` and the access to it is synchronized
  //   on `this`.
  //
  // - We do not run promises under a lock (`synchronized`) as it could lead to a deadlock if
  //   there are interleaved queue operations in the waiter closure.
  //
  // - Although promises are run without a lock, synchronized `state` transitions guarantee
  //   a promise that needs to be run is now owned exclusively by a caller, hence no concurrent
  //   updates will be racing with it.
